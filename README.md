# Video2Video Mimic Workflow for ComfyUI

This repository provides a ComfyUI workflow for advanced video2video transformation using a mimic technique integrated with multiple ControlNets modules and a KSampler refiner for LCM output. It delivers fast, high-quality results similar to Viggle.

## Workflow Overview
- **Video2Video Mimic Technique:** Utilizes a robust video2video method.
- **ControlNets Modules:** Integrates Reactor, FaceSwap, Control GIF, DepthMap, and OpenPose.
- **KSampler Refiner:** Enhances the LCM output for improved animation quality.

## Getting Started
